Striking a balance between maximizing revenue and maintaining customer satisfaction is crucial.\n",

This information can help tailor marketing strategies and promotions to target the larger market segment interested in city hotels.\n",

This might make it challenging for the business to differentiate itself and attract customers, potentially leading to negative growth.\n",
